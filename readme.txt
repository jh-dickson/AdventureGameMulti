This is a simple game with a single objective: gain 5 "stars".

In order to gain these stars, you'll have to fight off the creatures that you stumble across around the map.
There are varying types of creatures, and each will give you a different number of stars.

In order to help you fight them off, you may find swords in the boxes dotted around the map.
Also in these boxes are items of food, which will decrease your hunger levels.

If your hunger levels get to 25, you will take damage whenever you move.

The controls are simple, use the arrow keys to move around and the enter key to open a box.
The enter key will also refresh your stats in the bottom window. Use this to make sure your hunger doesn't get too high.
When in a fight, you will be given a choice as to which action to take. It will prompt you to use a certain key.

Here is a key of the map symbols:
    [Blank]: Grass
    T:       Tree 
    B:       Box 
    W:       Water

Settings:

    2) Seed: This will set the initial seed for environment generation.
